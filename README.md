According to Wikipedia, 2-3-4 trees are self-balancing data structure that is commonly used to implement dictionaries. 2-3-4 trees are B-trees of order 4.

The Code
=================
This is probably one of the most difficult algorithm I had to implement. We are given a header file template to work with and we are tasked to implement the following functions:
- bool Add(T& toCopyAndAdd)
- T* Find(int key)
- bool Remove(int key)

Future Improvements
===================
- The goal was to implement the 2-3-4 algorithm, but I have plans to dig deeper with my implementation and make some changes to ensure efficient implementation.
- Use the algorithm for real world applications
- Find ways to improve it
